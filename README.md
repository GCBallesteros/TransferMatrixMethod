# Transfer Matrix Method
A transfer matrix method for thin film calculations.

The computation is fully vectorized across the frequency dimension, that is, all frequencies
are calculated in single pass through the structure as opposed to many other libraries
out there. The price to pay for this is a somewhat increased memory footprint.
